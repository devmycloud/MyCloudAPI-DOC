This documentation is split into two primary topics, the RESTful API
specification itself, and the PHP SDK documentation. For those who
are working with PHP, it is recommended that you use the PHP SDK,
which will make your job much easier, as well as make maintenance
much simpler. For those who are working with other languages, you
will need to work with the RESTful API directly.

In either case, you may wish to read the API overview pages to get
an understanding of how the API works and what it presents to you.
Below are the links to these overview pages, as well as links to
the RESTful API and PHP SDK documentation.
