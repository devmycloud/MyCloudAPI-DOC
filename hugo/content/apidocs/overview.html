<h1>API Overview</h1>
<p>
	The MyCloud API is a RESTful API providing access to your MyCloud
	shop and the data associated with your shop. The current release
	of the API does not implement access to every element of your shop.
	It is designedprimarily to facilitate managing your customer, products
	and orders. Future releases of the API will continue to add more
	functionality.
</p>
<p>
	The API is implemented using standard HTTP connectivity and standard
	HTTP protocols. Therefore, you should be able to connect to and use
	the API using any language with support for HTTP and it's related
	standards.
</p>
<p>
	Please refer to the <a href="/apidocs/rest/">RESTful API</a> to navigate
	all of the documentation related to the API. This documentation will
	define all of the models used by the API, as well as the available
	routes you can use to manage these models.
</p>
<p>
	The
	<a href="/apidocs/php/">MyCloud API PHP SDK</a>
	is provided to assist those who
	are developing their applications using PHP. With this SDK, all of
	the low-level work involving setting up connections, making requests,
	encoding and decoding objects, and handling errors is provided for
	you. With the PHP SDK, you can make simple calls with pre-defined
	models to work with the API.
</p>
