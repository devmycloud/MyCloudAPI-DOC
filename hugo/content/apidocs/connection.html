<h1>Connection</h1>
<p>
	The MyCloud API is a RESTful API implemented using the HTTP protocol.
	This means that all connections to the API are the same as any other
	HTTP connection, which is the protocol used by every web browser to
	access a website. The advantage of the HTTP protocol is that it is
	a well established standard that is supported by every modern
	programming language in use today.
