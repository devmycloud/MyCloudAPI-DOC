<p>
	The Order model represents an order placed with your shop. Orders
	consist of OrderItems, which are the Products that are attached
	to the order. An order can have a Customer attached to it, but
	this is not required. And order must have a DeliveryMode attached
	to it to select the method of shipment. The payment attributes
	are provided for the customer to indicate to the shop when and how
	payment was made so the shop can verify payment. If payment was
	received through an online payment system, the shop may store
	that information in the order if they want.
