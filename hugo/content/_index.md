The MyCloud API is a RESTful API that provides MyCloud clients with
secure programmatic access to the functions needed to manage their
shop, products, inventory and orders. As a RESTful API built on
standard protocols, the MyCloud API can be easily accessed using
any programming language that supports HTTP protocols.

This documentation will describe the RESTful API protocols, as well
as the PHP SDK that is provided to simplify the use of the API when
using the PHP programming language.

The following links provide access to the two primary areas of
documentation - the RESTful API specification and the PHP SDK.

The MyCloud API is maintained on <a href="">GitHub</a> for your
convenience. We will selectively accept pull requests from clients who have
found bugs in the code. Or you may submit patch diffs directly
to <a href="mailto:dev@mycloudfulfillment.com">dev@mycloudfulfillment.com</a>.
